# Portfolio of Michael Bullock

## Description

The objective of this assignment is to create a portfolio of my current work for the coding BootCamp. The portfolio is designed with HTML structure and CSS styling. I plan to use this portfolio to showcase my coding skills to colleagues and peers. 

The User Story for this assignment is below:

-AS AN employer
-I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
-SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

The Acceptance Criteria for this assignment is below:

-GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
-WHEN I load their portfolio
-THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
-WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
-THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
-THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
-WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
-THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
