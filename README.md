# Portfolio of Michael Bullock

## Description

The objective of this assignment is to create a portfolio of my current work for the coding bootcamp. The webpage includes About Me, Work, and Contact Me sections. The portfolio is designed with HTML structure and CSS styling. I plan to use this portfolio to showcase my coding skills to colleagues and peers.
